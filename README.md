## General Information
This repository contains three different small coding exercises in three different branches. Each branch is named after the project. 

## Practices Included
The three different practices are a kitten formula calculator, a program that counts the number of flips needed to have an alternating binary number, and a 
program that finds the largest number in an array that is divisible by 4. 

## Technologies
All projects were created in Intellij Idea using Java 14.

## Setup
The main class for each project was included for each project to show code examples. The code can be copied and ran in a Java compiler of the user's choice.
